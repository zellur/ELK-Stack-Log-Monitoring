# ELK Stack for Log Management

## Overview

This project sets up a fully functional ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, Metricbeat) stack using Docker and Docker Compose. It provides a centralized log management solution for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing logs from various sources.  This is ideal for monitoring applications, troubleshooting issues, and gaining insights into system behavior.

## Features

*   **Dockerized:**  Uses Docker containers for easy deployment and portability.
*   **Docker Compose:**  Simplifies the orchestration of multiple containers.
*   **Centralized Logging:**  Collects logs from various sources into a single location.
*   **Real-time Analysis:**  Provides real-time log analysis and visualization.
*   **Scalable:**  Easily scalable to handle large volumes of log data.
*   **Customizable:**  Configurable to meet specific logging requirements.

The ELK stack consists of the following components:

*   **Elasticsearch:**  A distributed search and analytics engine that stores and indexes the logs.
*   **Logstash:**  A data processing pipeline that collects, transforms, and forwards the logs to Elasticsearch.
*   **Kibana:**  A data visualization dashboard that allows you to explore and analyze the logs stored in Elasticsearch.
*   **Filebeat:** A lightweight shipper that collects logs from your applications and forwards them to Logstash.
*   **Metricbeat** A lightweight shipper that collects server metrics.

## Prerequisites

*   Docker: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
*   Docker Compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
*   Sufficient system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to run the containers.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zellur/ELK-Stack-Log-Monitoring.git
    cd ELK-Stack-Log-Monitoring
    ```

2.  **Start the containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will download the necessary images and start the containers in detached mode.

3.  **Verify the containers are running:**

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see containers for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and (if included) Filebeat.

## Configuration

*   **Logstash Pipeline:**  The Logstash pipeline configuration is located in the `logstash.conf` file.  You can customize this file to define how logs are processed and filtered.
*   **Filebeat Configuration:** The Filebeat configuration is located in the filebeat.yml` file.  You'll need to configure Filebeat to collect logs from your applications.

## Accessing the ELK Stack

*   **Kibana:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5601`.  You can use Kibana to explore and analyze the logs.
*   **Elasticsearch:** Access the Elasticsearch API at `http://localhost:9200`.

## Usage

1.  **Import Data:** Configure Filebeat to send logs to Logstash.
2.  **Create Kibana Index Patterns:** In Kibana, create an index pattern that matches the index name used by Logstash.
3.  **Visualize Data:** Use Kibana's visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and dashboards to analyze your logs.
